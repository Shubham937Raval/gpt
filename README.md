This is a software which works on chatgpt api.

Here are the steps, which you have to follow if you want to make this code:-
1. Go to openai and get your api key.
2. Only if hit the rate limit(Optional):-if you hit your rate limit then it won't work, so in that case you will have have to create a new account or upgrade the plan.
3. Now go to Authentication, where you will find link of api keys.
4. Create new secret key -> give it's name -> copy that api key(this will be generated only once so save it somewhere) -> then paste that key in the place of "YOUR_API_Key"
5. And the code runs!!!
